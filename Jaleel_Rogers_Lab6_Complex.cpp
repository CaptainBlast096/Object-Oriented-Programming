 * Description:
 * In this lab, you must separate your class definition from its implementation. Design a
class named Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex that contains:

1) A double data field (private) named real for the real part of a complex number.
2) A double data field (private) named img for the imaginary part of a complex
number.
3) A no-arg constructor that creates a default complex number with real 0.0 and
img 0.0.
4) The accessor and mutator functions for real and img.
5) A user-defined constructor that creates a complex object with given two data
fields.
6) A method of the class (inside of the class) named printComplex that prints the
given complex number on the console. (3 + 4i or 2 â€“ 8i, etc.)

void printComplex ()
7) A method of the class (inside of the class) named addition returns the sum of
two complex numbers.
Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex addition (Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex &comp)
Hint: You must call the function with a complex object in the main function.
Therefore, you only need to provide the second object as an argument.

8) A function (outside of the class) named additionTwo returns the sum of two
complex numbers.

Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex additionTwo (Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex &comp1, Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex &comp2)

Hint: Because this function is not defined and implemented inside of the class,
you should provide two complex numbers.

9) A function (outside of the class) named additionArray returns the sum of an
array of Jaleel_Rogers_Lab6_Complex objects. You are also allowed to use vector of complex
numbers instead.
